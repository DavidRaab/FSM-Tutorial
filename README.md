Another approach to implement the provided Finit State Machine (FSM). The provided
approach is in my opinion a typical over complicated solution. A State is not more
than basically choosing a function for every state, and maybe having a transition
between states.

Turning each functions into its own class does not simplify anything or makes anything
more reusable than a plain old function.
